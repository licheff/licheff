project-title: Konstruktive Real Estates
project-category: Web app
project-description: Konstruktive Real Estates is a website aiming to showcase
  our client's projects. The key features of the website include searching for
  properties based on user preferences, booking inspection hours, news about the
  properties and showcasing the projects. I took main part in creating the whole
  UX of the project including wireframes, prototyping in InVision and after
  client's approval turning the UX into UI. Everything was done under the
  competent art direction of Marian Naydenov.
article: "**Lorem Ipsum**is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
  industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
  the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
  make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
  the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
  popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
  Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
  PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
